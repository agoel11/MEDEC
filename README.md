# MEDEC
MEDEC is a website that uses machine learning to provide healthcare information to people without affordable or accessible healthcare and information regarding it.

This website uses Flask and Python for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JS for the frontend. We also used Tensorflow, Keras, and Sci-Kit Learn to create the model.

The file model.h5 is the file of the fully trained model that we created. This file works with application.py in order to process the data that we recieve from the front-end JS. We use HTML and CSS in order to style the front-end website. This project was submitted to the STEMist Hacks Hackathon.

Here's a video of us describing MEDEC. The problem, solution, and demo is all there. https://vimeo.com/724266000
