# MEDEC
MEDEC is a website that uses machine learning to provide healthcare information to people without affordable or accessible healthcare and information regarding it.

This website uses Flask and Python for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JS for the frontend. We also used Tensorflow, Keras, and Sci-Kit Learn to create the model.
